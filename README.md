<h2><b>Synopsis</b> </h2>
<br>
<br>
<p>My website is designed to display a list of national parks and let users filter them by specific criteria, such as park type (like "National Park" or "Historic Site") and location (specific states). It uses dropdown menus to allow users to select their preferences and then displays only the parks that match the chosen criteria. If no parks match, a message is displayed.

The site dynamically updates the list based on user selections, ensuring a smooth and interactive experience for exploring park options.</p>
